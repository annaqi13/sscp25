# Automatic DICOM preprocessing pipeline

</div>

This code reads in DICOM files and generates GPFiles for personalised biventricular mesh fitting for the entire cardiac cycle.

## Usage

-----------------------------------------------

## Download models
The preprocessing pipeline uses deep learning models for view prediction and segmentation. These can be downloaded from ([here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/54662zpqpb0ibmoysqy54/AF4eN0-Bzmb7O-l1lJ6WCZI?rlkey=wxahs4jcepd8ryhh0nfersne2&st=75oy73u9&dl=0)). They should be placed in the biv-me repository like so:

    ```
    src 
    └─── bivme
        └─── preprocessing
            └─── dicom
                └─── models
                    └─── Segmentation
                    └─── ViewSelection
    ```


## Import libraries
This preprocessing pipeline utilises PyTorch and nnU-Net. The default biv-me conda environment currently doesn't install either of these for you. To set these up, activate the biv-me conda environment, like so:

```
conda activate bivme311
```

Then, find the PyTorch right version for your GPU and OS ([here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)) and install it as described on the website.

After PyTorch has been installed, install nnU-Net like so:

```
pip install nnunetv2
```

### Before running
Set up the directories in the config file located at src/bivme/preprocessing/dicom/configs/preprocess_config.toml. If you wish, you can create a new config file for each time you want to make changes. Just make sure to update the argument you call the code with.

All directories will be created for you except for the 'source' directory. This should point to your DICOMs, separated into folders by case like so:

    ```
    source
    └─── case1
        │─── *
    └─── case2
        │─── *
    └─── ...
    ```

Don't worry about preprocessing your dicoms, separating by scan type, or excluding non-cines. The pipeline should find which ones are cines and which ones aren't by checking key terms within the series descriptions. Check src/bivme/preprocessing/dicom/extract_cines.py for the list of key terms.

### Preprocess DICOM files for fitting
The main script for running the preprocessing pipeline can be found in src/bivme/preprocessing/dicom. This runs the pipeline on all images stored within the main DICOM folder you provide it. The output is a set of GPFiles for each frame of each case, which can be used for fitting.

```
usage: run_pipeline.py [-h] [-config CONFIG_FILE]

Preprocess DICOM files for fitting

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -config CONFIG_FILE, --config_file CONFIG_FILE
                        Config file containing preprocessing parameters

```

You can also run the preprocessing from a Jupyter notebook, in the same directory, named run_pipeline_interactive.ipynb. This notebook runs case by case. It is particularly useful if you would like some tighter supervision over certain aspects, such as the view prediction. 

## Outputs
The outputs of the preprocessing pipeline are a SliceInfoFile.txt, containing slice metadata, and GPFile_*.txt - one per frame. To generate biventricular models from these GPFiles, refer to the main README.
